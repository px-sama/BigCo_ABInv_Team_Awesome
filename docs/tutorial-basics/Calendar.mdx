This views in this data set collectively represent a robust series of definitions for the most often used time periods within the Gregorian Calendar. These views can either be used for reference if loading calendar elements as part of development of a reporting solution or referenced when direct querying sales, shipment or production data to analyze STRs or STWs within a given time period such as Days, Calendar Weeks, ISO Weeks, Months, Quarters or Trimesters.

# How to query data

<!-- export const text = 'This is the most granular and most dynamic of the Calendar views that defines each Date on the calendar. For nearly any possible query requiring or including a date, this should be the primary view referenced. It includes a wealth of attributes about a given Date including corresponding time frames from the prior year for quick year over year analysis.' -->
